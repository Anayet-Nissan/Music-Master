When you play steel drums, they should be hung at approximately waist height. Hanging your instrument too low may result in you having to bend and can cause your waist to ache. Hanging it too high may cause you to lose the natural position of your arms and inhibit effective playing. Your body position and stance should allow you to play steel drums (steel pans) comfortably. Proper body position also will facilitate good playing technique and musical creativity. If you experience discomfort such as aching feet when you play steel drums, this may be due to a poor playing stance. Pain will inhibit both the mental and physical aspects of your musical progress on your instrument.



Stand with both feet firmly planted and your weight evenly balanced between them. Standing with most of your weight on one foot may cause that foot to ache if you play for an extended period. This poor playing stance will not allow you to comfortably shift your playing between pans for steel pans (steel drums) such as double tenors and the other lower steel pans (steel drums) that use more than one drum



How far from the steel pans (steel drums) should you stand? When you play steel drums, you should stand at a distance that allows you to play every note without your body resting against the steel drums. Your elbows should be kept slightly away from your body so that you will be able to move freely without feeling cramped when you play the notes that are closest to your body.
